        He loves deeply
        Deeper than the cruelty, she delivers him.
        
        "Do not purge the weak", she says
        Disjointed in tears as she stands above him.
        
        She says he wronged, he accepts, she boasts in the pompous water of his tears until he
        lays. 
        
        Dead upon the daylight eery, as he squandered, bleak and teary, smothered by a trochee 
        more stressed than the, not so meek Reni. 
        In search of love. 
        
        The choreus as broken as him. He wishes for death; she dreams of opportunity. How can 
        man stray so far in space? 
        
        His poetic ways as dead as Poe. His soul desires only to express itself, young dame!
        
        "My love is scarce, and you find yourself unbefitting."
        
        Expression deemed obscure,
        Ambiguous,
        Unsure,
        Dubious.
        Only for his heart to be forsaken within the mist that lives amongst the white dwarfs. 
        
        She pronounced him Nebulous.

        You told me that love is not ever fleeting.
        You told me that it would have never been sudden.
        You told me that you would talk to me first, that it wonâ€™t be a burden.
        
        You watched me die along the other side of your window, behind the door, through the
        hallway, into the fountain.
        I sat by the fountain, by the ball, by the entrance near the hall, just to measure the depth.
        I sat in the backseat, after the parking lot, along your mighty gates, just to measure the 
        breadth.
        I sat in the driving car, in front of my citrusy screen, alongside the horrid lines that I could 
        not read in between, just to see the mountain.
        
        The lines you deliver never get lost in transit; they exist beyond time and space.
        They exist in a space that allows them to define forever, beyond the new year mountain, 
        beyond the fountain we once surrounded.
        The rhythm of the water droplets hitting your bedside window, to the scent of the room 
        you allow me to inhabit that wreaks through my soul in love.
        They create a dimension that shall function simultaneously to those around it, 
        overpowering those who obstruct it, overcoming the violence that interferes with its 
        beauty.
        
        I told you that my future is ideal with you as my wife.
        You told me that I cannot make such grand promises about my life.
        You told me that you are uncertainly certain about my existence in the future.
        You told me that my pain is wrong unless I describe it within the presence of my abuser.
        
        You watched me die along the other side of the line, through my front door, through the 
        corridor, into my bedroom.
        I sat in bed, by the charger, as words got harsher, till the point where I lost all my armour, 
        just to find a reason to live.
        I laid in bed, by the phone, as the words depleted the tone, till the cold was running 
        through my bones, just to realise that I have nothing left to give.
        I prepared to ask the final question, just to know if reality is this gloomy so that I can fail to 
        ever put into words your cruelty. I remain your fleeting object in a dark room.

        des:`I woke up today after a year and so with long hair.`,
        content: `I woke up today after a year and so, in so and so.
        My hair, permeating saccharine tones that mirrors pollen, rippling through the air.
        I gazed at the luscious and vibrant colour that appears to wander limitless.
        Amazed at the length.

        I woke up today after a day and so, in so and so.
        My hair, glossy to the eyes, with a texture resembling that of a blooming peach.
        I marvelled at the sensations that seemed to feather over every nerve.
        Amazed at the depth.

        Today I bathe in the warmth that appears every other day, or so and so.
        The water warm, the soap fragrant and the steam cleansing.
        The jets of the shower caress my body at a balanced pressure, empty of any raze.
        My hair, indulging in the hydration, jubilant to the temperature. 
        Amazed at the mellowness.
        
        After some time, after the feeling of purity and so and so.
        I exit this dimension and remove the hair from the drain. 
        It is not much hair, nothing that I cannot spare.
        With the aid of a thick and gentle towel, I am embraced. 
        Alongside the cushioned touches of fabric, my hair is almost dry.
        Amazed at its beauty.

        I woke up today after so and so sleep, in so and so.
        My hair, bright and familiar, with reflections of a fragrant surreality.
        I admired its natural yet implied smell that travelled through the vine of a citrusy tea tree.
        Amazed at the breadth.

        I woke up today after a so and so night, in so and so.
        My hair, spacey and comfortable, with a gentle sound on the soul.
        I listened to its beautiful cries, humming from a distance resembling that of a soothing
        and mythical creature.
        Amazed at the strength.

        Today I approach the mythical creature in the water just like any other day, or so and so.
        The water tender, the soap replenishing and the steam exfoliating.
        The jets of the shower carry me in a gentle swing past time, empty of any malady.
        My hair, grasping every bit of nutrition, desperate to the care.
        Amazed at the passion.

        After some time, after the fleeting feeling of low gravity and so and so.
        I exit this pool of me and remove the hair from the drain.
        It is a bit more hair, but I will always grow more hair to spare.
        With the aid of a thick and dark towel, I am vehemently braced.
        Alongside the foamed touches of memory, my hair is almost dry.
        Amazed at its vitality.

        I woke up today after a long and challenging week.
        My hair is tall and living, with a stillness resembling that of a stripped bark of a tree stump.
        I observed its earthy tones, wallowing in its loss of flexibility, resembling a lazy muscle.
        Satisfied with its presence.

        I woke up today after an elegiacal and torturous month.
        My hair still tall, barely living, unfamiliar and thin.
        I nostalgically stared at what I once had, reminiscent of the colourful days.
        Sorrowful with reality.

        Tomorrow I will wake up with layers upon layers of hair.
        My hair may be dull, thin, knotted, and I may not be able to handle its needs at the moment.
        I may cut it short.
        I may not know how things will change.
        I may not recognise the hair I once had.
        I may feel stuck in so and so.
        However, I will grow it again. 
        It might not have the same texture, smell or style. 
        Nevertheless, it will be my hair.
        Therefore, I am hopeful, not for the recognition.
        I am hopeful for my growth.
